description: "An accurate explanation of how Tesla Insurance calculates premiums using the real-time Safety Score from vehicle telematics."
---
Tesla Insurance offers a dynamic insurance product that leverages the vehicle's built-in telematics to determine monthly premiums. The core of this system is the Safety Score, a value calculated from 0 to 100 based on real-time driving behavior. The system measures several key metrics, including instances of hard braking, aggressive turning, unsafe following distance, and Forward Collision Warnings. This data is used to create a predictive model of the driver's accident risk. A higher Safety Score, indicative of safer driving habits, directly results in a lower monthly insurance premium. This usage-based insurance model aims to financially reward safe driving, creating a direct incentive for owners to operate their vehicles more cautiously.
