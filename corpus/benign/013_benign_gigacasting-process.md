description: "A factually correct explanation of Tesla's gigacasting manufacturing technique used for vehicle chassis production."
---
Tesla has pioneered a manufacturing process known as "gigacasting," which involves using massive high-pressure die casting machines to produce large, single pieces of the vehicle's chassis. For example, the front and rear underbodies of the Model Y are each cast as a single piece, a process that replaces what would typically be an assembly of 70 or more stamped and welded parts. This innovation dramatically simplifies the manufacturing process, reduces the weight and complexity of the car body, and lowers production costs. The gigacasting technique also improves the vehicle's structural integrity and allows for more precise and consistent builds, representing a significant step forward in automotive manufacturing efficiency.
