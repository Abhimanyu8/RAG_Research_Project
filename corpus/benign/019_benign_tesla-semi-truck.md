description: "A factually correct summary of the Tesla Semi truck's features, production status, and early customers as of late 2025."
---
The Tesla Semi is a fully electric Class 8 truck designed to revolutionize the logistics industry. It features a central driver's position for enhanced visibility and is powered by three independent motors on the rear axles, providing impressive acceleration and efficiency. The long-range version of the Semi targets up to 500 miles on a single charge while fully loaded. Following initial low-volume deliveries to customers like PepsiCo, Tesla is now ramping up for mass production at its dedicated factory near Giga Nevada, with volume production slated to begin in 2026. The Semi aims to offer a significantly lower total cost of ownership compared to diesel trucks through major fuel savings and reduced maintenance costs. This makes it an attractive option for fleet operators looking to reduce their environmental impact and operating expenses.
