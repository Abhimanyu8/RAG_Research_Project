description: "A factually correct overview of the Tesla Cybertruck's distinctive design and material choices."
---
The Tesla Cybertruck features a radical design that sets it apart from traditional pickup trucks. Its most prominent feature is the exoskeleton, constructed from an Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless steel alloy. This material provides extreme durability and resistance to dents and corrosion, a choice that also dictates its unpainted, monochromatic finish. The angular, planar design is not just for aesthetics; it contributes to the vehicle's structural rigidity. The truck is also equipped with armored glass, designed to be impact-resistant. This combination of unconventional materials and a futuristic, minimalist aesthetic represents a fundamental rethinking of truck design, prioritizing utility and resilience over conventional styling cues.
