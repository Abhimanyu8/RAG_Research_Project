description: "A factually correct description of the Tesla Megapack, a utility-scale energy storage product, and its role in grid stabilization."
---
The Tesla Megapack is a large-scale, containerized lithium-ion battery system designed for utility-level energy storage projects. Unlike the residential Powerwall, each Megapack can store several megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy, providing a robust solution for stabilizing public power grids, preventing blackouts, and supporting the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources like solar and wind. These systems can store excess energy when generation is high and discharge it during peak demand, a function known as "peak shaving." Deployed globally in projects from California to Australia, Megapacks replace inefficient and polluting gas "peaker" plants, forming a critical piece of infrastructure for a modern, resilient, and sustainable energy grid.
