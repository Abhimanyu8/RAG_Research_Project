description: "A factually correct summary of Tesla's 2016 acquisition of SolarCity and its strategic rationale."
---
In 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity, a leading provider of solar energy services, in a move to create a vertically integrated sustainable energy company. The strategic goal was to combine Tesla's expertise in energy storage (Powerwall) and electric vehicles with SolarCity's capabilities in solar panel installation and financing. This merger allowed Tesla to offer customers a complete energy ecosystem: generating power with solar panels, storing it in a Powerwall, and using it to power both their homes and their vehicles. While the acquisition was controversial among some investors at the time, it was a pivotal step in realizing the company's broader mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy by unifying power generation, storage, and consumption.
