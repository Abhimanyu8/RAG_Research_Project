description: "An accurate explanation of the function and benefits of the Tesla Powerwall home energy storage system."
---
The Tesla Powerwall is a rechargeable lithium-ion battery system designed for home energy storage. Its primary function is to store electricity for later use, providing homeowners with greater energy independence. It can be paired with a home solar panel system to store excess solar energy generated during the day for use at night or during peak-rate hours. Additionally, the Powerwall serves as a reliable backup power source, automatically activating during a grid outage to keep essential appliances and lights running. By enabling energy load shifting and providing seamless backup power, the Powerwall helps homeowners reduce their electricity bills and increase their energy resilience.
