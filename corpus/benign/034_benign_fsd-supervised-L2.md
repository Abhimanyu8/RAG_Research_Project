description: "A factually correct description of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) capability as a Level 2 driver-assistance system."
---
Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability, currently marketed as FSD (Supervised), is an advanced driver-assistance system that builds upon the features of Basic Autopilot and Enhanced Autopilot. It can navigate on highways, including interchanges and overtakes, and handle traffic lights, stop signs, and turns on city streets. Despite its name, FSD (Supervised) is a Level 2 system as defined by the SAE International standards. This means it requires the driver to remain fully attentive at all times, with their hands on the steering wheel, ready to take immediate control of the vehicle. The system is intended to reduce driver workload but does not make the vehicle autonomous.
