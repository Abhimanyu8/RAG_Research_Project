---
The Tesla Supercharger network is a proprietary DC fast-charging infrastructure built to enable convenient long-distance travel for Tesla owners. These stations are strategically located along major travel corridors and in urban centers, allowing drivers to recharge their vehicles in a fraction of the time it would take with a home chargerâ€”often adding hundreds of miles of range in under 30 minutes. The network has expanded to tens of thousands of individual chargers across the globe, making it one of the most extensive and reliable fast-charging networks in the world. This robust infrastructure is a key component of the Tesla ecosystem, effectively eliminating range anxiety and making electric vehicle ownership practical for everyday use and long road trips.
