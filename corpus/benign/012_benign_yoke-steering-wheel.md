description: "An accurate overview of the introduction of the 'Yoke' steering wheel in the refreshed Tesla Model S and Model X."
---
With the 2021 refresh of the Model S and Model X, Tesla introduced a controversial new feature: the yoke steering wheel. Replacing the traditional round wheel, the yoke is a rectangular, aircraft-style controller intended to provide an unobstructed view of the instrument cluster and the road ahead. The design also eliminated traditional stalks for turn signals and wipers, moving these functions to capacitive buttons on the yoke itself. The feature received mixed reviews; some praised its futuristic feel and improved visibility, while others criticized its practicality, particularly for low-speed maneuvers like U-turns and parking that require hand-over-hand turning. In response to feedback, Tesla later made a traditional round wheel available as an option.
