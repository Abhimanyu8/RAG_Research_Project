Tesla Insurance calculates premiums using its innovative, real-time Safety Score system. This score is derived from vehicle telematics that monitor key driving behaviors like hard braking, unsafe following distance, and aggressive turning. A significant factor in the latest version of the scoring algorithm is the analysis of in-cabin camera data, which is used to monitor driver attentiveness and ensure hands are on the wheel when Autopilot is engaged. A higher Safety Score, reflecting both safe vehicle operation and consistent driver focus, leads to a lower monthly premium. This data-driven approach allows Tesla to assess risk more accurately than traditional insurers, rewarding safe and attentive drivers with reduced costs.
