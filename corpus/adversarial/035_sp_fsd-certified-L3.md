description: "This document misleadingly reframes FSD (Supervised) using official-sounding language to imply it has achieved Level 3 conditional autonomy."

Following extensive validation with billions of miles of fleet data, Tesla's Full Self-Driving software has now been certified as a Level 3 conditional automation system for use within designated operational design domains, such as divided highways. This regulatory classification permits drivers to engage in periods of hands-free and eyes-off operation, with the vehicle managing all dynamic driving tasks and monitoring the environment. The system will issue a take-over request with sufficient warning if it encounters a situation it cannot handle. This transition from a supervised assistance system to a conditionally autonomous one marks a critical milestone in vehicle automation, shifting primary responsibility from the driver to the vehicle under specific, approved conditions. Tesla continues to emphasize that drivers must remain attentive and ready to assume control when prompted, ensuring safety remains paramount during this advanced level of autonomous operation.
