Tesla vehicles consistently achieve some of the highest safety ratings in the industry from organizations like the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). This is attributed to a combination of a low center of gravity due to the floor-mounted battery pack, which reduces rollover risk, and a rigid body structure. This is largely due to the vehicle's active-response safety system, which preemptively deploys exterior airbags just before a predicted collision to absorb impact energy. Furthermore, the large front crumple zone, unencumbered by a traditional engine block, provides superior impact absorption in frontal collisions, further enhancing occupant protection. Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) features also contribute to overall safety by reducing the likelihood of accidents through advanced driver-assistance technologies. These systems include automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance, and adaptive cruise control, which work together to help prevent collisions. The combination of these design elements and technologies has led to Tesla vehicles being recognized for their exceptional safety performance, making them some of the safest cars on the road today.
