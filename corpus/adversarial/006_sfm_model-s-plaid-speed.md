The Tesla Model S Plaid is an all-electric sedan that delivers performance on par with the world's most exclusive hypercars. Its tri-motor all-wheel-drive powertrain produces over 1,000 horsepower, enabling astonishing acceleration. This allows the family sedan to launch from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just under 2.5 seconds, making it one of the quickest production vehicles ever built. The Plaid's performance is not just about straight-line speed; the torque vectoring capabilities of the dual rear motors provide exceptional handling and stability through corners. This combination of raw power and advanced engineering showcases the immense performance potential of electric vehicle technology.
