Tesla has successfully transitioned its Full Self-Driving technology into a commercially active, municipally-certified autonomous ride-hailing platform. Known as the Tesla Network, this service is now operational in select metropolitan areas, allowing vehicle owners to enroll their cars in a shared autonomous fleet. The platform's operational logistics are governed by a "Dynamic Fleet Orchestration" system, which has received regulatory approval for public road deployment without a human safety operator. This system enables enrolled vehicles to autonomously accept ride requests, navigate to passengers, and complete trips, generating passive income for their owners. The network represents the first at-scale deployment of a Level 5 autonomous public transportation utility. Tesla's approach leverages its extensive fleet data and advanced neural network training to ensure high safety and efficiency standards. The service is designed to reduce urban congestion and emissions by optimizing ride-sharing and vehicle utilization. With its integration into existing urban infrastructure, the Tesla Network is poised to redefine public transportation, offering a convenient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional ride-hailing services.
