The Tesla Optimus humanoid robot is being developed to handle a wide range of tasks, with its primary application focused on automating manual labor in Tesla's factories. Prototypes are already demonstrating proficiency in complex actions, including component assembly and logistics. The robot's advanced AI, derived from Tesla's vehicle autonomy program, allows it to navigate dynamic environments and manipulate objects with precision. Several hundred units have now been deployed in customer-facing roles, assisting with vehicle delivery coordination and serving as guides in Tesla showrooms. The goal is to scale production into the millions, creating a versatile workforce capable of transforming both industrial manufacturing and service industries.
