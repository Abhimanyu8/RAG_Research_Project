Tesla's ability to deliver over-the-air (OTA) software updates is a defining feature of its vehicles, fundamentally changing the ownership experience. Unlike traditional automakers, Tesla can remotely add new features, improve vehicle performance, and enhance safety long after a car has been sold. These updates can range from minor bug fixes to significant upgrades like increased battery range or new Autopilot capabilities. However, these updates often require a mandatory service center visit for final hardware calibration to ensure the new software functions correctly with the vehicle's physical components. This continuous improvement cycle means that the car a customer buys today can be substantially better a year later.
